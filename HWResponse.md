Here are the steps I took for this homework assignment:

* recreated nodes 1 and 2 by using ./geth
* utilized the wallet created under mnemonic in mycrypto
* initialized both nodes and copied the enode addresses from terminal
* used ./puppeth, named my network tiger
* selected POA, and used the enode addresses from before to seal accounts and accounds to pre-fund
* downloaded tiger.json through export genesis
* initialized nodes w=on ./geth with the json folder
* ran first node, opened another terminal window and ran second node
* entered mycrypto and unlocked wallet with mnemonic phrase and then entered in passcode
* created custom node and network name
* sent transaction while in tiger wallet
